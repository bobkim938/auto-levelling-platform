        Description: This is a function to get the offset values
            for linear acceleration calibration for mpu6050. In this function
            essentially what were doing is calculating a line of best fit in
            which the x-axis is the acceleration and the y axis is the offset.
            The line is assumed to be a linear fit and we are using least squares
            method to find the slope and the y-intercept. For more details on the math
            please see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8hT5nDai6A

        Parameters:
        calibration_time[int]: Time in seconds you want to calibrate
            mpu6050. The longer the time the more accurate the
            calibration
        axis[int]: type in what axis you will be calibrating. You should do all 3
            ideally but this code you can only do one at a time.
            Three choices ax -> 0, ay -> 1, az -> 2

        Outputs: Outputs an an m and b value for the equation:
            y = (m * x) + b! You can plug in x (aka measured acceleration)
            to get the offset y in your application of the sensor!
